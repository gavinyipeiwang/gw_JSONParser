# gw_JSONParser
Implement a JSON parser.

The main purpose of this exercise is to get myself better understand parsing techniques. It's not meant to be a serious implementation as there are a lot of good ones already. The reason I choose JSON rather than a toy language is because of the simplicity of its grammar.

The first step is to define abstract JSON type and each value type. For the details of JSON grammar and its format, please refer to http://www.json.org/. Think about how to handle NaN values.
